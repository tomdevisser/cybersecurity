Considerations when evaluating information:

- Source — identify the author or organization publishing the information
- Evidence and reasoning
- Objectivity and bias
- Corroboration and consistency

- "exact phrase"

## Specialised engines

- Censys — search for internet-connected hosts, websites, certificates and other internet assets
- VirusTotal — virus-scanning service for files, using multiple antivirus engines
- Have I Been Pwned (HIBP) — tells if your email address has appeared in a leaked data breach

## Vulnerabilities and exploits

### CVE

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures program is a dictionary of vulnerabilities, providing standardised identifiers for vulnerabilities and security issues in the form of a CVE ID.

The MITRE Corporation maintains the CVE system.

### Exploit Database

Exploit Database lists exploit codes from various authors; some are tested and marked verified.

### GitHub

Also contains many tools related to CVEs, along with proof-of-concepts (PoCs) and exploit codes.
