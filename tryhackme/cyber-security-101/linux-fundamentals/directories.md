# Common directories

## /etc

Short for etcetera, a commonplace to store system files that are used by your operating system. For example the `passwd`, `sudoers` and `shadow` files.

## /var

Short for variable data, stores data that is frequently accessed or written by services or applications. For example log files from running services in /var/log.

## /root

The home of the root system user.

## /tmp

Short for temporary, a volatile directory used to store data that is only needed to be accessed once or twice. Any user can write to this by default, making it useful while pentesting.
